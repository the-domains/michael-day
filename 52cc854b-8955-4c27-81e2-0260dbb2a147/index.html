I'm going to start mine with one. I was muskie fishing at a remote lake in western Maryland when I suddenly found a 4-foot fish thrashing about at my feet. It was the first time I ever encountered a muskie, and of course, I got excited. Maybe a little too excited. I started sweating profusely, a fact which didn't really surprise me given that it was 93 degrees in the middle of August. I was also breathing heavily. Well, of course I was, there was a muskie at my feet! The fact that my chest was pounding didn't seem unwarranted given the circumstance. But after the fish spit the hook and took off for deeper waters, I was still sweating and my heart was still struggling. After making another dozen casts, I started to think I ought to call it a day.</p><p>My car was all the way on the other side of the lake, and the one-mile walk around started to look like a long hike. By now, I was aware that something in my chest wasn't right, and I fumbled for my cell phone to get some help. No bars. That wasn't going help. Obviously, I was going to have to walk the whole way around and there was no one else within sight. I started the trek, slowly putting one foot in front of the other through the long grasses. Halfway around the lake I found myself on the ground.</p><p>I knew I was in trouble, and that death was close at hand. I said aloud, "God, I want to live. God, I want to live." But God's answer was to lodge even more pain into my jaw, contorting my face. Through my grimace, I cried out, "God, I want to live with Carol Ann!"</p><p>I'm sorry, had I not mentioned that I married a living saint? Carol Ann is a church organist who regularly speaks with the Almighty about what music she should play on any given Sunday, and more often than not, He answers her. I should imagine the two are on a first name basis. And so when I invoked the name of my lovely wife, God responded in the form of a cool breeze on a blistering hot afternoon. The pain in my jaw subsided, and in ten minutes I was back on my feet. Another ten minutes went by before I could start walking back to the car again. All told, it took me an hour to get to the car, and another two hours before I pulled into the Emergency Room.</p><p>Our local hospital had just built a new cath lab, but no one knew how to use it, so they were bringing in a doctor from GW to teach them. He was one of the doctors who had repeatedly saved Dick Cheney during his multiple heart attacks. He came up to Hagerstown once a week from DC, and as luck (?) would have it, this was that day. He discovered I had thrown a blood clot that had completely blocked my right coronary artery, and two other arteries were closed down 80% as well. Three stents later, I was asking him if he ever had second thoughts about saving Cheney.</p><p>Now, a lot of people might give up fishing after that, but as you might have guessed, I am not a lot of people. Besides, I married a living saint. How bad could it get? So I decided to tempt the fates, and keep on fishing. And to keep on the good side of Carol Ann!</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21">Let&#x27;s start with a heart attack.</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
